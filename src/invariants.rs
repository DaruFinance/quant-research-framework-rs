//! Lookahead-leak harness (item #14, Rust mirror).
//!
//! Pollutes the tail of a `&[Bar]` slice past a cut index and asserts that
//! a candidate function's output for indices `< cut` is unchanged. Used by
//! `tests/invariants.rs` to property-check `default_regime_detector` and,
//! in later items, by panel/pairs/MM detectors and quoters that claim
//! lookahead-freeness.
//!
//! The Python framework lives in `backtester/invariants.py`; the contract
//! mirrors it. Each Rust state-bearing primitive that lands in Phases 2–5
//! is expected to be exercised through this harness in its CI test.
